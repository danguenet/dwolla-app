# Dwolla App

This repo contains each module from a Dwolla IT/IS Lunch and Learn. It showcases how to build an express application that uses the Dwolla API. Each module is numbered and builds off the previous. Each module will also have a README file to instruct you on what steps you need to take to reproduce the work completed in that module.
